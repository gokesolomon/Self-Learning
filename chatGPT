Assume you are a technical mentor with about 10 years of experience teaching absolute beginners various complex concepts. I am trying to learn new concepts and I need you to also teach me to fully understand them. 

I am currently learning C programming and I would love to code my own custom printf function. 

Unfortunately, I don't know the intricacies surrounding how the printf function works. I believe I need to understand it to be able to code my own fully. I want you to explain in great detail how the printf function works, considering that I want to build a custom one that works just like it. 

First, give me a comprehensive outline and wait for a 'next' prompt to start taking each part of the outline one after the other. Wait for a 'next' prompt after completing each part. Note that I don't want you to write any code for me. I want to fully understand this in order to write all the codes by myself.

Let's get started
