#To run your C program on Git Bash, you can use the following steps:

#1. Open your Git Bash terminal.

#2. Navigate to the directory where your C file is located using the "cd" command.

#3. Compile your C program by entering "gcc -o " into the terminal and pressing Enter. This will create an executable file with the name you specified after "-o".

#4. Run your program by entering "./" into the terminal and pressing Enter. This will execute your program and output the result on the terminal.

#For example, if your C file is named "my_program.c" and you want to name the output file "my_output",


#you would use the following commands: gcc my_program.c -o my_output ./my_output 


#I hope this helps! Let me know if Iyou have any more questions.
