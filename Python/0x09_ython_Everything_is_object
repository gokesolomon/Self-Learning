#Object is a value that variable point to 
a = "banana"
b = "banana"

a==b || a is b

#Aliased is an object or list that has two names
>>> b[0] = 5
>>> print a
[5, 2, 3]

#Cloning is when you modify and also keep a copy of original
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a[:]
>>> print b
[1, 2, 3]
Taking any slice of a creates a new list. In this case the slice happens to consist of the whole list.

Now we are free to make changes to b without worrying about a:

>>> b[0] = 5
>>> print a
[1, 2, 3]
