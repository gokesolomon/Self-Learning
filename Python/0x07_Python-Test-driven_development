#DOCTEST

#The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly asshown.

#The simplest way to start using doctest (but not necessarily the way youâ€™ll continue to do it) is to end each module M with:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

#Simple Usage: Checking Examples in a Text File
Another simple application of doctest is testing interactive examples in a text file. This can be done with the testfile() function:

import doctest
doctest.testfile("example.txt")
